## Key Design Decisions

### Why App Objects Instead of Custom Objects?

**App Objects** are deployed with your app and standardized across all customer accounts. This means:
- Customers don't need Enterprise accounts (eventually)
- Object schema managed by you, not customers
- Consistent data structure across all installations
- Easier support and debugging

### Why 50-Day View Instead of Full Month/Year?

- **Performance:** Loading 50 days of data is fast
- **Usability:** 50 days visible without scrolling
- **Flexibility:** Customers book both last-minute and far in advance
- **Scrollable:** Easy to navigate forward/backward

### Why One Slot Record Per Booking?

Instead of one slot per day:
- **Simpler data model:** Fewer records to manage
- **Better UX:** One booking = one record
- **Easier associations:** Single association to Deal/Contact
- **Visual clarity:** Spanning cells show booking duration

### Why Deal-Based Booking?

Instead of standalone booking:
- **Native HubSpot workflow:** Sales teams already use Deals
- **Revenue tracking:** Deals track value, stages, pipeline
- **Associations:** Deals already associate to Contacts/Companies
- **Reporting:** Use HubSpot's built-in Deal reports

---

## Success Metrics

### Track These KPIs

1. **Install Count** - Number of active installations
2. **Booking Volume** - Product Slots created per account
3. **User Adoption** - % of users who create bookings
4. **Revenue Impact** - Deal value from calendar bookings
5. **Support Tickets** - Issues reported (goal: < 5% of installs)

### Marketplace Goals

- **Year 1:** 100 active installations
- **Year 2:** 500 active installations
- **Year 3:** 1,000+ active installations
